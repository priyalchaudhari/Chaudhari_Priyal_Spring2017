      "\n",
      "Just got off the phone with the folks @ Dominion regarding some indicative pricing I gave them last week for (i) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in TVA; and, (ii) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in SERC.  FYI, I had quoted the TVA Call  @ $3.97/KW-mo ($1 over our mid) for a 4yr call beginning 1/1/03 with $2 VOM and 5x16 avail with 16hr mins.  I also quoted the SERC 7000 call at $1 over our mid, at $3.98/KW-mo for 1 yr and $4.12/KW-mo for 4 yrs, again with 5x16 and 16 hour mins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is --- this pricing generated some interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other (not bad) news is, they want us to refine our quotes in some respects.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the SERC calls, they're really interested in the new RTO GridSouth.  Harry, we need to see if we can identify a product today for what GridSouth will be tomorrow.  In addition, they are really interested in something more akin to a true synthetic, with intraday availability, say 2-3 hour notice with 4 or 8 hour mins.  (Since they are going to compare this to a real plant, I think we can take some latitude in calculating the VOM for shorter dispatch periods, since they would otherwise experience a start charge which would be spread over fewer hours).  Let me know what you think we can do.  We should probably talk about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the TVA call, they're happy with the quote I gave them, but would like the flexibility of 8 hour mins.  Let talk about this, as well.  I told them that size on the TVA would be in the range of 200-250.  They will check size on their side and I'd like us to affirm if this works for us, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would also like to see a Peaker Call in TVA with a June'04 start, 3-yr term, 4 hour notice, 4 hour mins, priced for Jun-Aug and Dec-Mar availability.  They'll get back to me on size.  In the meantime, let's talk about what we're interested in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry about the length of this message.  If I don't hear from you in an hour or so, I'll initiate the call.  My NY number is 212-715-5953.\n",
      "The exact location is Lakewood LMP.  There is a substation at Lakewood.  Plant location is 55 miles south of New York City on an exit ramp of the Garden State Parkway.  To my knowledge, the existing plant is not interconnected to NY.  In any event, pricing would be for PJM East. \n",

      "Brandon:  I assume the pricing is at the mids.  Also, since the spread between the 1.50VOM and the 3.00VOM is so small, I'll just quote the 1.50.\n",

      "Harry:  Please look at the entire email thread (to get a sense of all the metrics we're employing for this quote).  ConEd has already announced a 3x7FA peaker configuration for Lakewood, NJ.  The site is already owned by ConEd, part of an existing 230MW combined cycle plant they already own.  It's on the same transmission line (running to the south) as the Oyster Creek nuclear facility, which has a license expiration in 2009.  The existing plant is a non-merchant EWG, selling 215MW to JCP&L pusuant to a twenty-year PPA expiring in 2014.  ConEd has put out an RFP to sell 200-250MW of the peaking capacity from this planned facility.  They planned to have the unit operational by June 2002.  If we provide this synthetic toll, the plant construction would be deferred.  Let me know if we can do 350 to 500MW and let's talk about appropriate spreads above the mids.  Also, please be mindful of their desire for 8 hour mins.\n",

      "\n",
      "Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Specific points:\n",
      "EES will be a part of the new company.  \n",
      "Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  \n",
      "The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  \n",
      "Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.\n",
      "Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  \n",
      "ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  \n",
      "Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  \n",
      "In what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  \n",
      "Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  \n",
      "Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.\n",
      "All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.\n",
      "Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.\n",
      "Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  \n",
      "Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.\n",
      "Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.\n",
      "Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  \n",
      "Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.\n",
      "Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.\n",
      "With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.\n",
      "ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  \n",
      "BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.\n",
      "McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.\n",
      "Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.\n",
      "Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.\n",
      "Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.\n",
      "Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. \n",
      "The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.\n",
      "McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.\n",
      "ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.\n",
      "The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.\n",
      "Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.\n",
      "Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  \n",
      "McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.\n",
      "Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.\n",
      "Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.\n",
      "ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).\n",
      "Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'\n",
      "Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.\n",
      "Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.\n",

      "November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but acting\n",
      "weak and glum.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things like\n",
      "yesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely to\n",
      "aggravate that situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the Federal\n",
      "Reserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumers\n",
      "are too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who is\n",
      "familiar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authorities\n",
      "are concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to part\n",
      "with a dollar even as they are feigning confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report\n",
      "dated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit called\n",
      "G7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview\n",
      "1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "This poll was given to me by someone close to the Fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a \"good time\"\n",
      "to purchase a car or a house, but 63 percent said they \"did not feel like\"\n",
      "making a major purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75\n",
      "percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terrorist\n",
      "attacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstated\n",
      "because it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game but\n",
      "buckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americans\n",
      "refuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month and\n",
      "our unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent of\n",
      "those surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did a\n",
      "few months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cut is\n",
      "expected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when it\n",
      "announced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, putting\n",
      "them more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said in\n",
      "previous columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bank\n",
      "because it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things like\n",
      "mortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategy\n",
      "hasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as the\n",
      "surveyors concluded - \"the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between what\n",
      "Americans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans are\n",
      "feeling as they now confront economic decisions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What will yesterday's incident do to confidence?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains what\n",
      "happened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation like\n",
      "this - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while being\n",
      "weak in the knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Street\n",
      "was feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's plane\n",
      "crash, but snapped back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down and\n",
      "the stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain their\n",
      "confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is this\n",

The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.  \n",

      "One of the most dramatic battles between federal and state \n",
      "governments -- and a painful illustration of how drug prohibition \n",
      "cripples human dignity -- is brewing in Oregon, where a federal judge \n",
      "recently issued a court order to block U.S. Attorney General John \n",
      "Ashcroft from interfering with the state's physician-assisted suicide \n",
      "law.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Declaring that physician-assisted suicide \"was not a legitimate \n",
      "medical purpose for prescribing drugs,\" Ashcroft -- who earier had \n",
      "promised to uphold federalism over federal encroachment upon the \n",
      "states -- had threatened to have the medical licenses of \n",
      "participating doctors revoked.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Many civil libertarians, understandably, see Ashcroft's threat as a \n",
      "direct assault on human dignity in a matter too private and sensitive \n",
      "to allow government interference between doctor and patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, according to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz (member, Independent \n",
      "Institute Board of Advisors), the fundamental problem is that our \n",
      "laws make it unlawful to use lethal drugs to commit suicide -- \n",
      "except, as in the case of Oregon, when it is physician-assisted, and \n",
      "even then only under limited circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, no matter how painfully one may suffer from a \n",
      "terminal illness, one's ultimate choice must be prescribed by a \n",
      "physician.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly, this needlessly prolongs the suffering and anguish of \n",
      "those law-abiding sufferers who decide that waiting for nature to \n",
      "take its course is too long and too painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drug and suicide law reform, however, would help restore genuine \n",
      "dignity to those suffering from unspeakable pain. \"Physician-assisted \n",
      "suicide,\" writes Szasz in a new op-ed, \"is but one of the \n",
      "consequences of our drug laws.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By expanding their range of lawful options, drug and suicide law \n",
      "reform would enable the terminally ill to take matters lawfully into \n",
      "their own hands without interference from the state. It would also \n",
      "help lift the burden from physicians struggling to interpret the \n",
      "Hippocratic Oath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The American people are ceaselessly propagandized about the real \n",
      "dangers from which drug prohibitions are intended to protect us,\" \n",
      "Szasz concludes. \"The damage the prohibitions cause are glossed over \n",
      "in silence or, more often, are unrecognized. We avoid confronting \n",
