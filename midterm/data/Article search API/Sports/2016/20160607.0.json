Here are two excerpts from the book, http:\/\/www.ap.org\/books\/muhammad-ali\/index.html , that discuss what Ali called the 'slave name' that he rejected when he converted to Islam. The first excerpt, by reporter Rick Warner, looks back on Ali's defeat of Sonny Liston on February 25, 1964. (This report was first published on February 23, 1989). The second excerpt, by reporter Will Grimsley, tells how Ali adopted the Islam religion and the \"inner peace\" his religion brought him was responsible for his upset victory over Liston.
