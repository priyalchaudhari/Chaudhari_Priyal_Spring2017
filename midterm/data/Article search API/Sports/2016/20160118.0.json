Bernard passed away at home on January 16, 2016. He was 103 years old. He loved New York City. As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham. There will be a private family funeral service. Contributions in his honor may be made to the Herbert and Eileen Bernard Museum Judaica Fund at Congregation Emanu-El.

Loving husband of Lorraine, beloved father of Gregg and Jill, father-in-Iaw of Lauren and Jake and proud grandpa to Emma, Leah, Miles and Sadie. Richard was Senior Vice President and Senior Managing Director at Alliance Bernstein for 37 years, President of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and served on the investment committees of North Shore-LIJ Health System, The Association of Graduates of The Air Force Academy and the Legacy Heritage Fund. He was a board member of The American Friends of The Hebrew University. Richard initiated and funded a program at The Auschwitz Jewish Center, where cadets from the Air Force, West Point and The Naval Academies go to Auschwitz to study the Holocaust. He supported The Israel Sports Center for the Disabled, AIPAC and UJA-Federation. Richard was an avid swimmer, winning a gold and silver medal at the Maccabi Games in 1961 and met his wife Lorraine at the Maccabi Games in 1965. His passion for swimming led him and his swimming buddies to swim the English Channel in 2008 and they did a relay swim around Manhattan Island in 2013 to raise money for Multiple Myeloma. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy and a Masters in Business Administration from Babson College. He was a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) charterholder. Richard's optimism throughout his illness was an inspiration to us all. Funeral services will be held at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, 30 West 68th Street, New York, NY 10023 on Wednesday, January 20 at 10am. Donations may be made to: The Ichan School of Medicine at Mt.
